# A Short History of Llamas, Falcons, and Artificial Creatures

*Posted on 19.09.2023 by maddes8cht*

In the ever-evolving realm of artificial intelligence, history is etched with milestones that shape the landscape. Join me on a journey through time—a history that traces the footsteps of Llamas, Falcons, and the emergence of artificial creatures. This narrative is not just about models and algorithms; it's about the evolution of ethics, licensing, and the relentless pursuit of true OSI compliance.

### The Llama Saga Begins

Our story commences with Llama, a linguistic marvel birthed by Meta in February 2023. Originally intended for researchers, Llama quickly found its way into the hands of the inquisitive, thanks to leaked torrent downloads and URLs. However, the legality of these leaked variants remained a subject of fervent debate.

Llama's allure lay in its adaptability to specific domains, a feature distinguishing it from the ChatGPT crowd. It possessed the ability to run on personal hardware, making it a valuable tool for handling sensitive data. Building upon Llama's foundation, models like Vicuna emerged as Instruction-Following Models. Yet, not everyone had access to A100 graphics cards with 80GB of RAM. To address this, open-source solutions surfaced, aiming to reduce memory usage and enhance computational speed. Thus, an ecosystem of Llama descendants came into being, each finely tuned for diverse purposes, yet cloaked in legal ambiguity.

### The Rise of True Open Source Models

While the Llama lineage continued to evolve, another narrative was unfolding—an emergence of models committed to true OSI compliance:

1. **RWKV-LM**: This model, available under the Apache 2 license, presented a range of smaller sizes, catering to both 7B and 14B needs.

2. **OpenLlama**: An audacious endeavor to train a Llama-compatible model from scratch, although currently available in smaller sizes, hinted at expansion.

3. **MPT**: An independent model, offered in 7B and 30B sizes, under creative commons licenses (CC-By-SA-3.0 and CC-By-NC-SA-4.0).

4. **Falcon**: Originating from the United Arab Emirates, Falcon was initially released under its own license but swiftly transitioned to the Apache 2 license. Available in sizes of 7B and 40B, Falcon emerges as a powerful champion of "true" freedom in the AI model world.

### Llama 2: The Open Source Conundrum

Fast forward to July 2023, and Meta unveiled Llama 2—the next epoch in language models. Llama 2 made history as an open-source model, offering its boundless potential to both researchers and commercial users, free of charge. With parameter counts ranging from 7B to an astounding 70B, trained on 2 trillion tokens—double the context length of its predecessor—Llama 2 was a quantum leap in AI.

However, this release sparked a fiery debate over whether Llama 2 truly qualified as open source. Critics argued that Meta's licensing terms contained restrictions incongruent with the open-source ethos. The Open Source Initiative (OSI) emphatically asserted that Llama 2 could not bear the open-source label. They contended that Meta had misconstrued "open source" by introducing conditions and limitations that contradicted its definition.

The license agreement for Llama 2, published on July 18, 2023, granted users a limited license for usage, reproduction, distribution, and modification of Llama materials. However, it imposed commercial conditions that triggered when monthly active users exceeded 700 million. Additionally, restrictions limited the use of Llama materials for enhancing other large language models.

### Bridging the Gap with GGML and Llama.cpp

Simultaneously, as the Llama saga unfolded, a project named 'Llama.cpp' emerged on GitHub. This project was dedicated to quantization and inference for Llama models but later broadened its horizons to encompass other "free" models suitable for consumer hardware. Hugging Face became the epicenter for continuously releasing new fine-tuned models based on this technology, sparking widespread interest.

The synergistic relationship between Llama.cpp and Hugging Face gave rise to a substantial pool of fine-tuned models accessible to consumer-grade PCs. An increasing number of open-source software projects now harnessed this technology and these models, infusing them into novel and diverse applications.

### The Quest Continues

As we trace the history of Llamas, Falcons, and artificial creatures, our quest to champion true OSI compliance assumes greater significance. It's a journey that invites us to explore the ethical dimensions of AI, uphold the values of transparency, accessibility, and freedom, and engage with a community dedicated to expanding the frontiers of knowledge.

Join me on this quest. Whether you're a developer, a researcher, an AI enthusiast, or an advocate for open source principles, there's a role for you in this unfolding narrative. Together, we can redefine the ethics of AI, forge a future where knowledge remains a shared resource, and champion the cause of true OSI compliance.
