# About
I love to work with Blender, Python, C++, and I am excited about new AI technology.

AI is about to change our world, and it's up to us to shape it and give it direction.
It's my profound belief that the future of AI should be open, transparent, and accessible to all.

My current passion lies in the fascinating world of AI model quantization, particularly for Llama.cpp, where I'm committed to making powerful models accessible to all. It's a journey I'm enthusiastic about, and I believe in the importance of open, transparent, and accessible AI.

However, I can't do it alone. I'm well aware that this mission comes with its challenges, and my resources are limited. Your support can make a significant difference. Soon, I'll be setting up a Patreon or a similar platform to help fuel this endeavor. Please consider becoming a supporter if you're willing to contribute.
