# About
I love to work with Blender, Python, C++, and I am excited about new AI technology.

AI is about to change our world, and it's up to us to shape it and give it direction.
It's my profound belief that the future of AI should be open, transparent, and accessible to all.

My current passion lies in the fascinating world of AI, particularly using [Llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp), where I'm committed to provide powerful quantized models on HuggingFace accessible to all.

However, I can't do it alone. I'm well aware that this mission comes with its challenges, and my resources are limited. Your support can make a significant difference. Soon, I'll be setting up a Patreon or a similar platform to help fuel this endeavor. Please consider becoming a supporter if you're willing to contribute.

Please note that my focus is exclusively on quantizing truly free models, such as Falcon up to 40b, MPT, and others. This means of course:

No Llamas. No Llama 2. And, sadly, also no Falcon 180b. Llama models are well-supported elsewhere.
