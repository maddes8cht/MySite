Hey there, I'm maddes8cht, and I'm on a journey of exploration. My path has led me through the fascinating realms and possibilities of Blender, Python, C++, machine learning, and  Visual Studio Code.

But it's not just about the code for me. 🌱 It's about a vision of Open Source as a driving force in the world of AI. I'm on a mission to bridge the gap between open-source principles and AI models. I believe in the power of freely accessible knowledge and resources.

🚀 **Contribution to Open Source:** I specialize in converting true Open Source AI models. Thus my focus lies on models like Falcon and MPT that are in the spirit of open source.

🤗 ** Contribution to HuggingFace:** Through my participation in the Hugging Face community, I want to advocate for AI models that use true OSI-compliant licenses. Just as the community has enriched my journey, I want to give back and foster an environment of learning, sharing, and collaboration.

💡 **Stack Overflow Top Contributor:** Being in the top 3% of contributors in the current year, I have enjoyed interacting with other enthusiasts, and I look forward to more insightful discussions.

🌐 **GitHub:** Never created a general useful project myself, but actively contributing in some: [GitHub/maddes8cht](https://github.com/maddes8cht)
